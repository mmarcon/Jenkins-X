#Jenkins-X
###A OSX client for Jenkins

Jenkins-X is a small OSX client for Jenkins, the extendable, open source continuos integration server.

Jenkins-X displays the status of your Jenkins jobs and provides a simple meter that shows the stability of your builds. Additionally it integrates perfectly with OSX showing the current status of the build in the menu bar.

Jenkins-X is open source and built using open source components.

**Note:** This GIT repository includes the source code and the Titanium Studio project necessary to build your own version of the app.

More info about Jenkins-X can be found on the [official homepage](http://marcon.me/jenkins-x) and in the blog posts that describe it on [Side Project](http://blog.marcon.me).
